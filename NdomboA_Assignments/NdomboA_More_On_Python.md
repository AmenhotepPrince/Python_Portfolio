# More on Python Prompts

## 1) What extension do all Python files have?
".py"
## 2) What is the current version of Python?
Python 3
## 3) What is the previous version of Python?
Python 2
## 4) Describe the type of updates that ARE made to the previous version of Python.  Describe the type of edits that are NOT made to the previous version of Python.
The type of updates made are mainly bug fixes and such. The types of updates not made are addons to the codes functionality such as additional features.
## 5) What does it mean to be "backwards compatible"?
It means that newer versions may be configured to be compatible with the older versions.
## 6) Describe potential compatibility issues with different versions of Python.  For example what happens if you try to run a program program written in Python 3.xx on a Python 2.xx interpreter?  What happens if you try to run a program written in Python 2.xx on a Python 3.xx interpreter?  What if you try to run a newer Python 3.xx program on an older Python 3.xx interpreter?  What happens if you try to run an older Python 3.xx program on a newer Python 3.xx interpreter?
Running a newer 3.xx version on a 2.xx interpreter may cause difficulties with using new code that hasn't been implemented into the interpreter meaning it will be seen as an error. The same can be said about the 2.xx program with a 3.xx interpreter because the 2.xx program may contain strategies now seen as obselete and therefore discontinued and now full of bugs.
## 7) Describe five different implementations of Python.  What language is each built on?  Which is the default implementation of Python?
Cython, Jython, Rpython, CPython, and PyPy. Jython is java, CPython and Cython is C, Py Py and RPython use both C and Python. The defualt implementation is CPython.
