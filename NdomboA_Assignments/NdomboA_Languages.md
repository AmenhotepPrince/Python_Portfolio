# Programming Languages Review Prompts

## 1) Explain how a computer might break down a complex task, such as calculating your grade,  into a series of simple operations.
A computer breaks a complex task into many tiny steps that it executes one at a time.

## 2) What is an instruction list?
An instruction list is a sequence of commands telling a computer what actions to perform.

## 3) What is a program?
A program is a collection of instructions that a computer follows to complete a task.


## 4) Describe how computing devices physically store data.
Computing devices store data as patterns of tiny electrical charges or magnetic states.

## 5) Explain how a computing device would store numerical data.
Numerical data is stored as binary numbers made of 0s and 1s.

## 6) Explain how a computing device would store a character.
A character is stored as a numeric code, such as its ASCII or Unicode value in binary.

## 7) Explain how a computing device would store the color of a pixel.
The color of a pixel is stored as binary values for its red, green, and blue components.

## 8) Describe what machine language is.
Machine language is the set of binary instructions a computer’s processor can directly run.

## 8) Describe what natural languages are and provide at least two examples of a natural language.
Natural languages are the spoken or written languages people use, like English and Spanish.

## 9) Describe what a low level programming language is and provide at least two examples of a low level programming language.
A low-level programming language is close to machine code, such as C++

## 10) Describe what a high level programming language is and provide at least two examples of a high level programming language.
A high-level programming language is human-friendly and abstract, such as Python or Java.

## 11) Rank the following types of languages in order from most human friendly (least computer friendly) to most computer friendly (least human friendly): Asssembly Language, Natural Language, Machine Language, High Level Programming Language, Low Level Programming Language.
Natural Language → High Level Programming Language → Low Level Programming Language → Assembly Language → Machine Language.

## 12) What are the four fundamental elements of language?  Describe each.  Where appropriate, include examples in your descriptions.
The four fundamental elements are syntax, semantics, pragmatics, and vocabulary.
