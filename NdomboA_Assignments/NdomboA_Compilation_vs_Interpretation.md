# Compilation vs Interpretation Review Prompts

## 1) What is the purpose of compiling and/or interpreting programs?
The purpose is to translate the high-level programming language into something that the computer understands - machine language.
## 2) Describe the compilation process.
The source program is translated once (however, this act must be repeated each time you modify the source code) by getting a file (e.g., an .exe file if the code is intended to be run under MS Windows) containing the machine code; now you can distribute the file worldwide; the program that performs this translation is called a compiler or translator
## 3) Describe the interpretation process.
You (or any user of the code) can translate the source program each time it has to be run; the program performing this kind of transformation is called an interpreter, as it interprets the code every time it is intended to be executed; it also means that you cannot just distribute the source code as-is, because the end-user also needs the interpreter to execute it.
## 4) Provide two examples of compiled programming languages.
C, C++
## 5) Provide two examples of interpreted programming languages.
Python, JavaScript
## 6) Explain the key difference between compiled programming languages and interpreted programming languages?
The difference is that with compiled languages are translated into machine code all at once then run right away, but interpreted languages are translated line by line every time the source code is ran.
## 7) What are the advantages of compiled programming languages?
The execution of the translated code is usually faster; only the user has to have the compiler - the end-user may use the code without it; the translated code is stored using machine language - as it is very hard to understand it, your own inventions and programming tricks are likely to remain your secret.
## 8) What are the disadvantages of compiled programming languages?
The compilation itself may be a very time-consuming process - you may not be able to run your code immediately after making an amendment; you have to have as many compilers as hardware platforms you want your code to be run on.
## 9) What are the advantages of interpreted programming languages?
You can run the code as soon as you complete it - there are no additional phases of translation; the code is stored using programming language, not machine language - this means that it can be run on computers using different machine languages; you don't compile your code separately for each different architecture.
## 10) What are the disadvantages of interpreted programming languages?
Don't expect interpretation to ramp up your code to high speed - your code will share the computer's power with the interpreter, so it can't be really fast; both you and the end user have to have the interpreter to run your code.
## 11) Explain what source code is.
A program written in a high-level programming language is called a source code
## 12) Explain what a script is.
Languages designed to be utilized in the interpretation manner are often called scripting languages, while the source programs encoded using them are called scripts.
